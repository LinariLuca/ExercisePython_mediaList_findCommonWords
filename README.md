# 🧮 Python Average & Common Words Finder

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue?logo=python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This project is a simple **Python exercise** that demonstrates how to work with **lists**, **strings**, and **sets** to solve two practical problems:
1. Calculating the average of a list of numbers
2. Finding common words between two input texts

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Check that all elements in a list are integers before calculating the average  
✅ Compute the average of any valid list of integers  
✅ Identify common words between two texts using basic logic  
✅ Alternative implementation using `set` operations for more efficiency  
✅ Sorted output for consistent readability

## 📂 Project Structure

- **ex1_git.py** – Main script containing:
  - **calculate_average()** method
  - **find_words_common()** and **find_words_common_with_set()** methods
- **README.md** – Project documentation

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required. The script uses only standard Python features.
